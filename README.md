## Overview
This project leverages NLP techniques and CNNs to train a model capable of identifying six distinct languages with high accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a subset of the [Wili-2018](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kaggle.com%2Fdatasets%2Fmexwell%2Fwili-2018) dataset from kaggle.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To train and test the model, run the ```main.ipynb``` notebook. This notebook contains all the steps from data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Results
The performance of the model can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score that are computed for every distinct language.These metrics help in understanding the effectiveness of the language identifcation model.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
